# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
  Constitution compliance: Every feature must have clear, justifiable objective.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]

- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

### Mobile-First Requirements *(Constitution Principle II)*

- **MOB-001**: Primary action MUST be tappable with minimum 44px targets
- **MOB-002**: Interface MUST be optimized for single-hand usage
- **MOB-003**: Content MUST be readable without zooming on mobile devices

### Performance Requirements *(Constitution Principle IV)*

- **PERF-001**: Interface MUST respond within 100ms to user actions
- **PERF-002**: Animations MUST maintain 60fps on target devices
- **PERF-003**: Content MUST be comprehensible within 8 seconds (Principle I)

### Accessibility Requirements *(Constitution Principle V)*

- **A11Y-001**: Contrast MUST meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
- **A11Y-002**: All functions MUST be accessible via keyboard navigation
- **A11Y-003**: Screen reader MUST announce all important state changes

### Content Requirements *(Constitution Content Rules)*

- **CONT-001**: All text MUST have clear function: inform, guide, or convert
- **CONT-002**: Error messages MUST guide users to resolution
- **CONT-003**: Generic placeholder content is PROHIBITED

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

### Constitution Compliance Outcomes

- **CC-001**: Primary action completion time under 8 seconds (Principle I)
- **CC-002**: Mobile usability score meets professional standards (Principle II & III)
- **CC-003**: Performance budget compliance: 100ms response, 60fps animations (Principle IV)
- **CC-004**: Accessibility audit passes WCAG AA requirements (Principle V)

## Assumptions

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right assumptions based on reasonable defaults
  chosen when the feature description did not specify certain details.
-->

- [Assumption about target users, e.g., "Users have stable internet connectivity"]
- [Assumption about scope boundaries, e.g., "Mobile support is out of scope for v1"]
- [Assumption about data/environment, e.g., "Existing authentication system will be reused"]
- [Dependency on existing system/service, e.g., "Requires access to the existing user profile API"]
